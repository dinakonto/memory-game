## Acknowledgement

The game utilises the [Fisher-Yates (aka Knuth) Shuffle function](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2450954/how-to-randomize-shuffle-a-javascript-array/2450976#2450976) provided in the Udacity starter code.

I also took inspo from [Bakudan on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7910506) in my approach to the timer functions.

üçªCheers!
